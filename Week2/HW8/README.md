# HW8 Solution

Unit tests for the Badger coin contract.
The tests should show that
1. The total supply is initially 1,000,000.
2. That the number of decimals is 18.
3. The balanceOf function returns the correct result.
4. The transfer function works correctly.
5. Test that an error is produced if a transfer is created with an insufficient balance.
